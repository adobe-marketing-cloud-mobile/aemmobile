2.  Install aemm
	
~~~~
	npm install -g aemm
~~~~
	
if that doesn't work, do the following...

    https://nodejs.org/en/
2.  Get the app from the repo and then use npm install and link.

~~~~
	git clone https://github.com/adobe-marketing-cloud-mobile/aemmobile.git

For Android, you may see couple compilation errors related to node-gyp when running "npm install" on Mac OS X and Windows.
It's safe to ignore them. They don't affect the functionalities of this tool.

#### Usage

There are 2 types of workflow this tool is designed for:
* Developing custom HTML content.
* Developing custom application with custom plugins.

Commands for both workflows:

`aemm platform install <platform>`

    aemm platform install android
 
Accept several Android SDK license agreements. This installs and updates various Android SDKs, build tools and setup system environment for developing Android application.
You may need to open a new terminal to have the new system environment settings take effect.

`aemm project create [PROJECT_NAME or PATH]`

	aemm project create TestProject
	
	aemm project create /path/to/TestProject

You must run the following commands inside the directory created with `aemm project create [PROJECT_NAME or PATH]`.  

`aemm article create [articleName]`

	aemm article create Article1
	
	aemm article create Article1 Article2 Article3
 
 
###### 1. Developing custom HTML content
  
`aemm app install <platform>`

	aemm app install ios

	aemm app install android
	
	aemm app install --list
	
	aemm app install ios 2016.5

You must run the following commands inside the directory created with `aemm project create [PROJECT_NAME or PATH]`.

run command without device parameter will run application in emulator/simulator.

###### 2. Developing custom application with custom plugins.

You must run the following commands inside the directory created with `aemm project create [PROJECT_NAME or PATH]`.

`aemm platform add [platform]`

	aemm platform add android
	
	aemm platform add ios

Add the platforms that you want to target your application at.

`aemm plugin add [plugin_0] [plugin_1] [...]`

`aemm run [platform]`

	aemm run ios

	aemm run ios --device

	aemm run android

	aemm run android --device

	aemm run ios --list
	
	aemm run ios --target "iPhone-6s, 9.2"

run command without device parameter will run application in emulator/simulator.

## NOTE

aemm was built on cordova and delegates many commands to cordova-lib. You may experience errors that recommend that you try to run a cordova command.
In most of such cases, please first try to replace cordova with aemm, then execute the recommended action.
